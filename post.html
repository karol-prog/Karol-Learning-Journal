          <p class="post-preview">
            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
            Path, I've made the big jump over to learning the fundementals of
            HTML, CSS and Javascript. The Scrimba is amazing platform for
            learning how to code.

            How I stay committed to learning
          </span>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While that was
          fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
          most things about my journey with the world.
          <span class="post-test-subhead"> How I got started</span>
          I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
          take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
          use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
          short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me
          grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning
          summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
